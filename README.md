# POC UploadStream

ðŸ”¬ Proof of Concept of a upload stream (multipart form data) from **React JS** and ** React Native ** app to **C# .NET Core** backend

This POC is based on a .NET Core API & React JS & React Native mobile app project.

```bash
dotnet new React
```
If you want to build your own project, follow these steps:

```bash

dotnet new React
yarn install
yarn upgrade react-scripts --latest
yarn remove eslint eslint-config-react-app eslint-plugin-flowtype eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-js-ally eslint-plugin-react babel-eslint
npm install --save react@16.4.0 react-dom@16.4.0
```

## Run

Just open the solution in Visual Studio and run the project.

A browser instance should open in localhost, navigate to **Upload** tab, select one or more files to upload (drag & drop enabled) and then click on the **Upload** button.

*After the upload, you should click the **Clear** button to send the same file again (some error with id of the files might occour if this action is not done).
